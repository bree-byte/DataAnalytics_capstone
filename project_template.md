*Data-Driven Insights for Indie Filmmakers to Maximize ROI*

## 1️⃣ Problem Statement  
Independent filmmakers face a critical challenge: **they need to pitch projects to investors with clear evidence of potential success**, but lack access to structured, quantitative insights that show which genres, directors, and actors are most likely to deliver high returns.  

Specifically, investors want answers to questions like:  
- Which **movie genres** yield the highest ROI?  
- Which genres are **critically acclaimed** versus financially successful?  
- Which **directors** consistently produce profitable movies (≥3 films)?  
- Which **actors** repeatedly contribute to high ROI projects (≥6 films)?  
- Which genres are **oversaturated**, and which are underserved yet lucrative (saturation vs opportunity)?  
  

Without this information, indie filmmakers risk pitching projects that are **financially unviable**, overproduced, or misaligned with audience demand. This project addresses these gaps by providing a **data-backed framework** to inform investor pitches and creative decisions.

## 2️⃣ Project Objective  
What are you trying to achieve?  
- Identify the most profitable movie genres between 2018–2025  
- Evaluate genre performance by both ROI and audience ratings  
- Highlight directors and actors with consistent track records for investor confidence  
- Map genres by **saturation vs opportunity** to guide strategic project selection  
- Produce an analytics-ready dataset and investor-facing interactive dashboard
